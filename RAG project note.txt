RAG project note
1. The questions like "what parameters I should check to optimize SAP HANA performance on VMWare vSphere?"
    might get a better response using vector search comparing to knowledge graph. We can implement a hybrid retriever
2. Handling images may require manually identify the images, apply OCR model and add the nodes.
    We need to assess whether it truly worth the effort (dev period, runtime cost)
3. need clarification on chain of thought portion
4. prompt engineering (both llm and retriever)
